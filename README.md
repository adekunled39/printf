This is my first group project with Oluwakemi Lasisi at Alx school. Its all about printf in c programming language . I will update you later on the details of this read me
This function is part of the standard library and to use it we must specify the header file <stdio.h>.
Writes the C string pointed by format to the standard output (stdout). If format includes format specifiers (subsequences beginning with %), the additional arguments following format are formatted and inserted in the resulting string replacing their respective specifiers.
